What is Symbolic Execution?

Symbolic execution is a technique used in software testing and analysis to systematically explore the possible execution paths of a program. Unlike traditional testing methods that use concrete values as inputs, symbolic execution utilizes symbolic values that represent variables, function arguments, or program inputs.
